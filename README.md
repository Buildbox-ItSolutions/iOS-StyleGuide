# The Buildbox iOS Style Guide

Welcome to the Buildbox! 

Now as a developer that will be responsible to make other people's dream come true, you should always strive for quality in our projects. Due to the increased amount of projects that you're going to work with, this guide was created to make sure that anyone in our team can hop between projects without problems to understand what is being done.
